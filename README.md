# CSS-THEME

This package npm acts as a CSS theme generator, offering the ability to customize the aesthetic of your websites. Using this package you can easily create a CSS style file containing various variables. All you have to do is choose a theme from a proposed list, and you will get all the associated CSS variables. These variables will then allow you to shape the style of your site according to your preferences.



## Installation

Install css-theme with npm

```bash
  npm install @pfe-css-theme/css-theme
```

At the base of the project, please create a directory named "assets", inside which you will need to add a "css" subdirectory. In the latter, place a CSS file named “variables”.

You now have the possibility to generate the theme of your choice by replacing themeName with the name of the theme you want:
```bash
  npm run theme themeName
```

Your "variables.css" file now contains the specific values of your selected theme.
